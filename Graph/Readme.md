There are Two types to make graphs
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List / Linked List
   
****
## Adjacency Matrix

Graph can be represented in adjacency matrix form with **vertices** (**V**) (nodes with data) and **Edges** (**E**) (connection/relationship of nodes)
**Graph** (**G**) is made up of these two **G(V)(E)**

- V = {0, 1, 2, 3}
- E = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2)}
- G = {V, E}

An Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array made of **V x V**. Both row and column represent vertices and **1** represents an edge between the vertices

***
## Adjacency List / Linked List
It represents graph in a linked list form where relationship between vertices are shown with the help of a linked list
